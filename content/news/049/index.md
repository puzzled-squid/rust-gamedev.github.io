Welcome to the 49th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

Here are the most notable updates:

- The game is now better optimized to run smoothly on the Steam Deck.
- Some of the textures have been revamped and are now slightly more detailed.
- The animations of the character portraits have been improved.
- Several minor quality of life improvements like the ability to sprint have
  been made.
- A basic egui-based crash reporter will now be displayed when the game process
  ends unexpectedly.
